SUMMARY

This has been the most difficult project to date. There were several challenges along the way that really pushed the learning curve forward. Figuring out how to display values in a way that allowed to execute different operations, was the most rewarding part of this project. Also, got a better understanding on how to create and call a function on a addEventListener() event.
